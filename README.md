# Vera Prometheus exporter

This is a plugin for [Vera][1] controllers which adds a [Prometheus][2] metrics
exporter.

[2]: https://prometheus.io/

## Exported metrics

The plugin currently exports metrics for a few different types of
sensors and devices:

Sensors:

 - Temperature sensors: `temperature_c`
 - Humidity sensors: `humidity_relative`
 - Light sensors: `light_lux`
 - Energy/electricity usage sensors: `electricity_used_kwh`,
 `electricity_usage_w`
 - Battery level: `battery_level_percent`
 - Security/motion sensors: `security_sensor_tripped`

Devices:

 - Dimmable bulbs: `dimmable_load_percent`

System:

 - Various system metrics from `/proc/stat`, attempting to be compatible with
 the Prometheus `node_exporter` exporter (`node_cpu`, `node_intr`,
 `node_context_switches`, `node_boot_time`, `node_forks`,
 `node_procs_running`, `node_procs_blocked`)
 - Various system metrics from `/proc/meminfo`, attempting to be compatible
 with the Prometheus `node_exporter` exporter (`node_memory_*`)
 - Some metrics about the LuaUPnP process itself from `/proc/self/stat`,
 attempting to be compatible with the golang Prometheus client library (
 `process_cpu_seconds_total`, `process_resident_memory_bytes`,
 `process_virtual_memory_bytes`)

## Installation

Upload all of the `.xml` and `.lua` files in this repository to your Vera
controller.

In UI7, you can do this by navigating to `Apps`, `Develop apps`, `Luup files`
on your controllerâ€™s web interface.

You also need to create a device to instantiate the loaded code in `Apps`,
`Develop apps`, `Create device` with `Upnp Device Filename` set to
`D_PrometheusMetrics.xml` and `Description` to `Prometheus Metrics` and
clicking `Create device` button.

Check that the metrics are being properly exported by pointing your browser or
a tool like curl to

```
http://<yourveraip>:49451/data_request?id=lr_prometheus_metrics
```

TODO: Publish this to the mios app store. Please contact me if you are
interested in this plugin and would like me to publish it to the app store.

## Configuration

The metrics are not exposed on the default `/metrics` path that most
Prometheus exporters expose their metrics on, so a little extra configuration
is needed. An example snippet to add to the `scrape_configs` section of your
`prometheus.yml` is:

```yaml
  - job_name: 'vera'
    scrape_interval: 15s
    metrics_path: /data_request?id=lr_prometheus_metrics
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['192.168.8.68:49451']
```

Of course, you should change the IP address in the example (`192.168.8.68`) to
the IP address of your Vera controller.
